<h1 stye="background-color:aqua;"><b> Dear Mom and Dad!</h1>
<p style="background-color:dodgerblue;"><i>I know I don't always say it, but I appreciate everything you've done for me.  Thank you for all the sacrifices you've made, the support you've given, and the unconditional love you've shown.
I remember all the late nights you spent helping me with homework, driving me to practices, and attending every single game. You always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and believed in me even when I doubted myself. You taught me the importance of hard work, kindness, and perseverance, lessons I carry with me every day.
I'm so grateful for the values you instilled in me and for always being there to offer guidance and a listening ear. You've shown me what it means to be a good person and have created a loving and supportive home.
I know I haven't always been the perfect child, and I'm sure I've caused you your fair share of worry and frustration. But through it all, your love and understanding never wavered.
Thank you for being the best parents I could ask for. I love you both very much.
Love always,
(Jude).</p>
